;;
;;; This is a table of various lisp flavors which Garnet has at one time
;;  or another been compiled on:
;;
;; allegro (Allegro Common Lisp, Commercial). Starting with version
;;         3.0 (currently at 6.2). Note that allegro has a special
;;         switch (allegro>= x y) which allows one to test for a
;;         specific version or later.
;;
;; lucid (Lucid Common Lisp, Commerical). Now out of business, bought
;;       by Allegro.
;;
;; lispworks
;;
;; cmu (Carnegie Mellon Lisp, Free). Open source lisp. Later versions
;;     support multiple processes (and cmu mp).
;;
;; clisp (C-Lisp, Free) Lisp to C compiler.
;;
;; kcl (Kyoto Common Lisp, Free).  Open source lisp.
;;
;; mcl (Macintosh Common Lisp, Commercial). Common Lisp for Macintosh.
;;     Version 3 and later has multiprocess support. Note was
;;     previously called "Coral Common Lisp" so uses abbreviations
;;     ccl, ccl-3 &c.
;;
;; apple This nominally refers to lisps running on Apple Macintosh
;;       computers. Apple paid for/assisted in support for porting
;;       Garnet to Mac OS in early 90s. With Mac OS X, Apple provides
;;       X windows support, so nominally we could run under CLX too.
;;       Probably many of these switches need to be changed to (and
;;       apple (not clx)). I'm still experimenting with Mac OS X
;;       version of garnet.
;;
;; Note that nobody ever paid the CMU development team for Windows
;; port. Contributions are welcome here. I am also working on an
;; OpenGL port which may make it easier to run cross platform.
