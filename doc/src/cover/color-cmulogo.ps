% Color-CMULOGO.PS
% Created by Brad Myers from Black and white logo that was in 
%        /usr/misc/.scribe/lib/database.v7/cmulogo.ps
%
% Description:
%
%	This is the PostScript version of the CMU Logo.  It
%	attempts to follow as closely as possible the standard
%	for the logo as set forth in the "Carnegie Mellon
%	Logo and Graphics Standard".  It is available from
%	campus printing.
%
%	The execeptions to the logo standard as published 
%	are that the font Time-Bold (ITC) is used in place of the
%	standard of Bauer Bodini Bold (Compugraphic).  Both
%	the Bauer Bodini Bold font and Times-Bold font are
%	Serif fonts and very similar in design.  The Bauer font
%	is slightly more condensed than the Times font.  The
%	same text set in the same pt size will use approx 10% less
%	horizontal space in a Bauer font that the same text set in Times.
%
%	This implementation does not enforce the standard that
%	minimum point size of the Carnegie Mellon name is
%	12 points.
%
%	The logo is printed at the origin (0,0), on the current page.
%	Many printers can not print near the border of the page.
%	This will cause the output to be clipped.  .i.e the entire
%	logo will not appear when this document is printed by itself.
%
%	We print the logo at the origin for backward compatability.
%	Scribe files that do not use BoundingBox=File, (.i.e those
%	that use "Height=x, Width=y" expect the lower left x and
%	lower left y to be at the origin.  By printing at the origin
%	we can satisfy both styles of use of @Graphic, at the expense
%	of having the diagram clipped.
%
%	This PostScript program also executes the showpage operator.
%	V5(1500) of Scribe does not disable the showpage operator
%	by temporarily binding it to a noop.  Using this PostScript
%	program inside of V5 of scribe will not produce the expected
%	results.  This problem was fixed in V6(1600) of scribe.
%
%	Also be aware of psrev and included documents.  Many printers
%	produce pages in the "wrong" order.  Due to the way these
%	printers stack paper on output, the first page printed ends
%	up on the bottom, face up.  The last page printed ends up on top,
%	face up.  Because of this, many spoolers pipe their PostScript
%	through the psrev utility.  The psrev utility uses the %%Page:
%	comments to reverse the order of the pages in a PostScript
%	document.  When a PostScript file is included in a another
%	there will be two page ones.  Some versions of the psrev utility
%	do not correctly handle the included PostScript file and fail to
%	reverse the pages.  Causing included PostScript files that
%	include other PostScript files to fail.

% Modifications:

%	Added %%EndProlog, part of Document Structuring Convention.
%	Changed dict size to 1, no longer need dict of size 2.
