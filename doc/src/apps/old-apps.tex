\majorheading{Some Garnet Applications}

This section presents some examples of applications written using
Garnet.  As of September 29, 1993, we know of over 50 applications
written using Garnet, listed below.  If you
are using Garnet and you are not in the list, please send mail to
\pr{garnetjcs.cmu.edu}.  The figures on the following pages show some
of the applications.  These were generated using the Garnet utility
\pr{Opal:make-ps-file}.  Many of these figures are in color, so if you
have a color printer or postscript previewer, you might try looking at
this file in color.

A collaborative project on an environment for the specification, testing,
maintenance and automatic generation of application software.
The context is batch process control in Chemical Engineering although
it is envisaged that the applicability of the environment will be more general.
A `domain expert' will be able to specify knowledge about plant
subsystems, plant configurations, and the allowable generic operations and
constraints on each plant subsystem. An `application engineer' will then use
the system to `glue' together predefined operations in order to make specific
products. The system will then generate process control code for particular
target hardware. Garnet is being used to capture and visualise plant and
process information through schematics, process diagrams, interactive
simulations and simple animations.

A mesh created using a virtual aggregate for the
polygons and another virtual aggregate for the square knobs.  For the
polygons, the virtual aggregate is passed a prototype for a
polygon, and an array containing the list of points and the color for
each polygon.   The virtual aggregate then pretends to
allocate an object for each element of the array, but actually just
draws the prototype object repeatedly.

THESEUS application used by the Tulane University Computer Science
Department on guided tours of the department given to visiting high
school seniors and other interested parties.  THESEUS is intended to
be used as part of a presentation on what the study of computer
science entails.  It does this by showing graphically the progress and
results of common search methods applied to the problem of finding the
exit of a randomly created maze.  THESEUS was developed in CMU Common
Lisp version 16d and the Garnet X-Windows toolkit version 2.01.

Roentgen is a case-based aid to radiation therapy planning.  It relies on
an archive of past therapy cases to suggest plans for new therapy
patients. Roentgen supports therapy planning by: 1) retrieving the case
which best matches the geometry and treatment constraints of the new
patient; 2) tailoring the plan to the specific details of the patient;
3) evaluating the results of applying the plan; 4) repairing the plan
to avoid any discovered faults in treatment results. This final plan
is the system's suggestion to the human planner. Roentgen breaks new
ground in solving problems in a domain dominated by spatial reasoning
and the satisficing of constraints.

The SURF-HIPPO Neuron Simulator is a circuit  simulation  package  for
investigating morphometrically and biophysically detailed models of single
neurons and small networks of neurons. SURF-HIPPO allows ready construction of
multiple cells from various file formats, which can describe complicated
dendritic trees in 3-space with distributed non-linearities and synaptic
contacts between cells. Cell geometries may also be traced from the histology
directly on the screen, using the mouse.   An extensive user interface is
provided, including menus, 3D graphics of dendritic trees, and data plotting.
Data files may also be saved for analysis with external tools.  A
research version of SURF-HIPPO
(available by anonymous ftp from ftp.ai.mit.edu [pub/surf-hippo]) is written in
LISP, and is configured to run using the public domain CMU Common Lisp and
Garnet packages. Our version is compiled for SPARC workstations, and should be
easily ported to other UNIX machines running X. LISP is a useful simulator
language because it has the benefits of a powerful interpreted script language,
but it may also be compiled. Thus it is convenient to integrate custom code
into SURF-HIPPO. The simulator may also be used with a minimum of programming
expertise, if desired.

This application is aimed at supporting the creation of text-based multi-user
domains. Current techniques use text-based tools to create these environments,
but these tools have very little computer support so complexity and consistency
are sacrificed.
Our new application supports the graphical creation of MUD areas and enforces
topological constraints together with hierarchical grouping of features.
The graphical tool can be used in a number of modes which allow the information
to be filtered, zoomed and viewed in 2.5 D. Areas created can be printed and
additionally they can be saved as native code that can be executed.

The SAGE project is developing systems which automate the process of
designing presentations of information.  An automatic presentation system is
an intelligent interface component which receives information from a user or
application program and designs a combination of graphics and text that
effectively conveys it.  It's  purpose is to assume as much responsibility
for designing displays as required by a user, from layout and color
decisions to broader decisions about the types of charts, tables and
networks that can be composed within a display.  The SAGE project is
developing an interactive data exploration environment which contains
automatic display design capabilities integrated with data navigation,
manipulation and modification tools. These tools are being used to
explore large amounts of diverse data from marketing, logistical, real
estate, census and other databases.

The Electronic Encyclopedia Exploratorium is an electronic

by experimenting with the components of
those devices in a lab simulation setting.  A causal model simulator
lies beneath the user
interface which simulates the current device and can provide
causal explanations of the results of that simulation.  Other
high-level tools are planned for future enhancement.

The calendar window shows the dark bar of the past sweeping, one pixel
each half hour of the day and night, across a horizontal line [not
visible in this Postscript image] summarising by its width and height
the user's working hours and appointments, tentative and firm.  The
marginal time tags can be dragged up and down, and it will eventually be
possible to type over the top of them to jump to a given time.  The
datebook window presents an expanded view of time as an infinite tape
from which appointment forms can be popped up by pointing or by sweeping
out free areas.  Most importantly, when arrangements involve several
people the system communicates with its peers and with meeting
participants by reading and writing email in German; the displays are
updated in real time.

The fields of the appointment form are semi-structured: they can
be filled in with the help of menus - such as that visible on the lower
window - that drop down from the small icons on the right; numeric, date
and time values within them can be incremented and decremented directly
with mouse buttons; and experienced users can type structured values
straight in.  Unconstrained German text (the graphic interface will soon
be English/French/German trilingual, but the natural language parser and
generator speak only German) can also be entered. It is routed to the
natural language system for analysis; planned improvements to the
pragmatics module will allow you to give up on the structured form
completely and type informal questions and instructions into the notes
field, as you might for a human secretary who had stepped out of the
room.
