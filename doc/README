These are the postscript files that make up the manual for Garnet
Version 3.0.  The first file (manual-cover.ps) is optional, and can be
printed in color, if you have a color printer.

All of these manuals will print single-sided, even if you have a printer
that can print double-sided.  The reason we have put code in the files to
explicitly make them single-sided is so that you can rearrange the table
of contents of each manual, and insert blank pages behind the title pages,
before copying them on a double-sided copier.  To see how blank pages can
be inserted into the single-sided copy so that it can be fed to a double-sided
copier, refer to the format of a previous version of the manual (e.g., the
Garnet 2.2 manual).

To create a manual, print all the postscript files (with something
like "lpr *.ps" or use the print-garnet-docs shell script), and then
assemble them in the following order:

manual-cover.ps
refman.ps
overview.ps
apps.ps
tour.ps
tutorial.ps
kr-manual.ps
opal-manual.ps
inter-manual.ps
aggregadgets-manual.ps
gadgets-manual.ps
debug-manual.ps
demoguide.ps
sampleprog.ps
gilt-manual.ps
c32-manual.ps
lapidary-manual.ps
hints.ps
index.ps


To quickly print all the files in the right order, you can execute the
shell script 'print-garnet-docs', found in this directory.  It uses the 'lpr'
command to send all the files to your default printer.  
  Ex:  csh print-garnet-docs

(Of course, you might want to print manual-cover.ps to a different
printer, so it will be in color.)


There is an additional file, changes3.0.txt, which discusses all the changes
that were made since the 2.2 release.  This document is a plain text file,
and is not printed by the shell script.  You may not even want to print this
document, because the complete 3.0 manual covers all of the material included
in the changes document.


If you have trouble printing the documents, some people have reported
that it works better to change the top line of each postscript file from
    %!PS-Adobe-2.0
to be just
    %!
