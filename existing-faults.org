* Font Size problem
  - Seems like it can't tell the difference between 100dpi and 75dpi fonts.

* Motif error gadget doesn't size the buttons correctly

* Old text button gadget doesn't handle color properly
  - See the "gadgets" demo

* Allegro process code seems broken.

* Multifont window flickers when scrolling or changing.

* Transcription replay doesn't work.
  - Not sure if it's bad output or a problem with input.
