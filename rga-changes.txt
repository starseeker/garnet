Changes I've made to the Garnet base.

1) Automatic loading configuration using truenames and (require :clx).
Affects loaders.  

2) Allowed last (Help) menu item in motif menu bar to be right
justified (Motif style guidelines).

5)
gadgets/save-load-functions.lisp:;;; 10/26/95 RGA --- Added ignore errors on (truename Prev-Dir).  This

6) Added some checks for valid windows which seemed to prevent errors
based on race conditions.  (Somebody else had made similar checks, I
think the two bits of code are compatable).
inter/i-windows.lisp:  10/27/95 RGA --- Add check for valid window is many handlers.

7) Cleaned up movegrowinter
inter/movegrowinter.lisp:        

8) Added a second value return to kr:g-value and kr:s-value which is
an error flag.

9) Some changes to track new versions of MCL

10) I commented out some redundant code in update-basics which
    seemed to be generating a problem
    (setf kr::*pre-set-deamon* NIL)
opal/update-basics.lisp:;;; RGA  --- This is reduntant and actually screws us up.
