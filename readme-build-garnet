This is a way to build garnet all the way to a lisp image with a single command.

Example:  ./build-garnet sbcl

Result: Garnet will be compiled, the fasl files will be moved into their target
directory and (in the case of SBCL) an executable image called "garnet" will be
produced in the current directory.

For it to work, you must configure the paths to the lisps you will use (at the
beginning of the file).
