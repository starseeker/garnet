;;;  This file contains functions for constructing a path through the

;;; CHANGE LOG:
;;;
;;; 11/25/92 Andrew Mickish - When src and dest are siblings, only optimize
;;;            when dest has a :known-as slot.
;;; 11/20/92 Andrew Mickish - Changed Marked-P and Set-Marked-Bit to use
;;;            local values only;  When pushing new link into :link list,
;;;            use pushnew instead of push.
;;; 10/01/92 Andrew Mickish - Created this file from functions in Lapidary
