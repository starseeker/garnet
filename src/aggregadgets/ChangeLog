  19 May 93 amickish  Called add-component/interactor inside Call-Create-Inst

                  aggregadget
  16 Jul 90 rbd   Changed compilation order: aggregadgets first
   8 May 90 rbd   Major changes for new version.
   11/28/89 ecp   Fixed bug in create-part such that aggrelists were not
                  getting initialized correctly.
    9/28/89 ecp   Aggrelists can now have :interactors slots, too.
    9/18/89 ecp   Copy-parts should not have been calling itself recursively.
    9/14/89 ecp   The :initialize method for aggregadgets has optional
                  second argument to keep track of top level.
    8/2/89  prm   Optimized code after review meeting.
    7/20/89 prm   Removed aggregitems (now integrated to aggrelists).
    7/13/89 prm   Changed to work with aggrelists.
    7/6/89  prm   Changed syntax (class names must be comma-ed) to keep
                  everything consistent.
    6/28/89 prm   Changed to accept open formulas. This involved a change
                  of syntax (:parts and :interactors are now lists)
    6/28/89 prm   Changed the syntax: now :parts and :interactors are
                  lists instead of multi-value slots.
    6/28/89 prm   Fixed a bug: now sets :behaviors properly
    6/23/89 prm   Quoted the names in calls to create-instance, in order

    6/8/89  prm   Added "element style" components (aggregitems)
    6/5/89  prm   Fixed a bug: now when copying a part that is an
                  aggregadget, create-prototype is called instead
                  of create-instance
    5/15/89 prm   Optimized the creation of instances of aggregadget
                  prototypes (makes copies of the prototype).
    5/11/89 prm   call-prototype-method moved to the beginning
                  of the :initialize method.
    4/18/89 prm   Changed again to match KR v2.0 (methods)
