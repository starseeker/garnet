Change log:
  05 Jan 94 amickish  Set-values ---> s-value
  15 Jun 93 amickish  In Get-Part-From-Function, don't set up :known-as if the
                      part-name is a number
  10 Jun 93 amickish  Moved definition of safe-functionp to garnet-utils
  20 May 93 amickish  Had to declare name slot of agget constant in Call-C-I
  19 May 93 amickish  Called add-component/interactor inside Call-Create-Inst
                      so that Create-Part and Create-Inter do not have to
                      add extra slot/value pairs to the slots list.
   7 Apr 93 amickish  Declared part-name constant in agget in Get-Part-From-Fn
  26 Mar 93 amickish  Removed EVAL from Call-Create-Instance for the last time!
  25 Mar 93 dzg  Added DECLARE-CONSTANT's in Get-Part-From-Function
  26 Feb 93 amickish  Rewrote Call-Create-Instance to use begin/end-create-
                      instance and not use copy-tree (ick).
   3 Jun 92 amickish  Wrote Get-Part-From-Function which allows a single part
                      to be generated by a function
  30 Apr 92 amickish  Bound kr::*redefine-ok* in Create-Part
  28 Apr 92 amickish  Wrapped destroy-slot calls in with-constants-disabled
   8 Apr 92 amickish  Made Call-Create-Instance non-destructive
   7 Apr 92 amickish  Wrapped calls to Call-Create-Instance in
                      with-constants-disabled.
  26 Mar 92 amickish  Get-Values--->G-Value; Get-Local-Values--->G-Local-Value
  16 Mar 92 amickish  Removed append-constant-slots -- obviated by KR.
  10 Mar 92 amickish  Fixed Call-Create-Instance to handle multiple-values
  03 Mar 92 amickish  Fixed Inherit-Values to use *inherit-formula*; broke
                      Get-Inherited-Value off from Inherit-Values
  28 Feb 92 amickish  Quoted class parameter in Call-Create-Instance
  24 Feb 92 amickish  Declared :components constant in :initialize method
  18 Feb 92 amickish  Implemented :constant slot functionality
  28 Jan 92 amickish  Rewrote create-part and create-inter to use
                  create-instance.  Changed name of first-obj-in-parts-list
                  to is-first-comp-in-parts-list.
  15 Apr 91 bam   Added the :behaviors slot to the :local-only-slots of
                  aggregadget
  16 Jul 90 rbd   Changed compilation order: aggregadgets first
   8 May 90 rbd   Major changes for new version.
   11/28/89 ecp   Fixed bug in create-part such that aggrelists were not
                  getting initialized correctly.
    9/28/89 ecp   Aggrelists can now have :interactors slots, too.
    9/18/89 ecp   Copy-parts should not have been calling itself recursively.
    9/14/89 ecp   The :initialize method for aggregadgets has optional
                  second argument to keep track of top level.
    8/2/89  prm   Optimized code after review meeting.
    7/20/89 prm   Removed aggregitems (now integrated to aggrelists).
    7/13/89 prm   Changed to work with aggrelists.
    7/6/89  prm   Changed syntax (class names must be comma-ed) to keep
                  everything consistent.
    6/28/89 prm   Changed to accept open formulas. This involved a change
                  of syntax (:parts and :interactors are now lists)
    6/28/89 prm   Changed the syntax: now :parts and :interactors are
                  lists instead of multi-value slots.
    6/28/89 prm   Fixed a bug: now sets :behaviors properly
    6/23/89 prm   Quoted the names in calls to create-instance, in order
                  to match KR 2.2
    6/8/89  prm   Added "element style" components (aggregitems)
    6/5/89  prm   Fixed a bug: now when copying a part that is an
                  aggregadget, create-prototype is called instead
                  of create-instance
    5/15/89 prm   Optimized the creation of instances of aggregadget
                  prototypes (makes copies of the prototype).
    5/11/89 prm   call-prototype-method moved to the beginning
                  of the :initialize method.
    4/18/89 prm   Changed again to match KR v2.0 (methods)
    4/07/89 prm   Changed to match KR v2.0
    3/28/89 prm   Added built-in interactors.
