;;;  Graphics-Selection:  Selection squares around graphic objects
;;;
;;;  Features and operation of the Graphics Selection object:
;;;    1)  Given a list of graphical objects, the graphics-selection
;;;        aggregadget will cause selection squares to appear on the bounding
;;;        box of selected objects.
;;;    2)  Only one item may be selected at a time.
;;;    3)  A built-in interactor displays the selection squares around an
;;;        object at the time of a specified event (such as clicking a mouse
;;;        button on the object).
;;;    4)  Each selection square allows the user to move or grow the object
;;;        by dragging the selection square.
;;;

;;; Programmer Interface
;;; ====================
;;;
;;; Create an instance of a GARNET-GADGETS:Graphics-Selection and supply the
;;; :start-where slot with a valid list that can be passed to an
;;; interactor.  This :start-where must return the items to be selected.
;;; It should be an ...-or-none form, such as element-of-or-none.  An
;;; example of the parameter to :start-where is:
;;; 		(list :element-of-or-none myagg)
;;;
;;; The :value slot of the GARNET-GADGETS:Graphics-Selection object will be
;;; set with the object the user selects.  Also, a :selection-function can be
;;; supplied and will be called each time the selection changes.  It takes
;;; these parameters: (Gadget New-Selection)
;;; The NewSelection may be NIL if the selection changes to be no objects.
;;;
;;; The user can change the size and/or position of the objects.  If the
;;; :check-line slot is non-nil, then the :line-p slot in the object returned
;;; by start-where will be g-valued, and if it is non-nil then the interactor
;;; will change the object as a line.  Note that the programmer must set the
;;; :line-p slots of the objects (since often composite objects like arrowlines
;;; will be used, and just asking (is-a-p obj Opal:line) on these will
;;; return false).  The programmer can supply a :modify-function that will
;;; be called after an object is modified.  It takes these
;;; parameters: (gadget selected-object new-points)
;;; The new-points will be a list of 4 numbers, either
;;; left,top,width,height or x1,y1,x2,y2
;;; 
;;; In summary, public slots of the Graphics-Selection objects are:
;;;    :start-where - supply a valid start-where here
;;;    :check-line - if T, the objects are checked for their :line-p slot
;;; 			and if that is non-NIL, then move or grown as a line
;;;    :running-where - if supplied, then this is the area in which the
;;; 			objects can move and grow
;;;    :value - current object selected
;;;    :selection-function - this is called when the selection changes
;;;    :modify-function - this is called when an object is changed size or
;;;                       position
;;;    :movegrow-boxes-p - whether it is OK to move and grow non-lines.  If
;;; 			   NIL, then will beep if press on a square to
;;; 			   change a non-line.
;;;    :movegrow-lines-p - whether it is OK to move and grow lines.  If
;;; 			   NIL, then will beep if press on a square to
;;; 			   change a line.
;;;
;;; Slots of the objects that can be selected are:
;;;    :line-p - this should be T if the object should be moved as a line,
;;; 		and NIL if as a rectangle
;;;    :points - if :line-p is T, then the :points slot of the object is
;;; 	        changed as the object is moved or grown.
;;;    :box - if :line-p is NIL, then the :box slot of the object is
;;; 	        changed as the object is moved or grown.
;;;

;;; End User Operation
;;; ==================
;;;
;;; The user can press on any object with the left button, and it will
;;; become selected.  Pressing on the background, causes no object to be
;;; selected (the current object becomes de-selected).  Since only one
;;; object can be selected at a time, selecting an object causes the
;;; previous object to be de-selected.
;;;
;;; Once an object is selected, it can be grown by pressing with the left
;;; button on one of the black boxes or moved by pressing on a white box.
;;; While moving and growing, if the mouse goes outside of :running-where
;;; or if the ^G key is pressed, the operation aborts.
;;;
;;; Test and debugging routines are NOT in this module.  See demo-grow for an
;;; example of how to use this gadget.
;;;
;;;  Designed and written by Brad Myers
;;;
;;; Changes:
;;; 14-Dec-92 Andrew Mickish - Added type and parameter declarations
;;; 22-Jul-92 Andrew Mickish - Added top-level :start-event and :active-p slots
;;;  9-Apr-90 Robert Cook - in the creation of Graphics-Selection,
;;;			    removed ignore declaration.
