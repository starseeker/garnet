ChangeLog:
  11 May 94  Mickish Put in correction for kr::*no-value* in Transitive-Closure
  28 May 93  DZG  Converted to KR 2.3.
  21 May 93  Brad Myers fixed interbytes.
  26 May 92  ECP  In datasize, use opal constant to determine size of
		  update-info struct, instead of calling length.
  25 May 92  ECP  In formula-bytes, check if a-formula-depends-on
		  returns a list.
  9  Apr 92  DZG  Fixed compilation problems for 2.0.8.
  1  Apr 92  DZG  Fixed compilation problems for 2.0.6.
  31 Mar 92  DZG  Eliminated problem in AGGBYTES which caused the detailed
		  breakdown to always show only one object per type.
  27 Mar 92  Mickish  Put call to kr::schema-slots in-line in objbytes rather
                  than binding the result in a let*.
  18 Feb 92  DZG  added two new exported functions, COUNT-FORMULAS and
		  WHY-NOT-CONSTANT.  The first can be used to tell how
		  many formulas (evaluated or not) are left in an aggregate;
		  it recursively prints the names of all slots that contain
		  formulas.  The second function tells why a slot in a schema
		  is not marked constant.

  10 Feb 92  DZG  rewrote objbytes, datasize, formula-bytes to work with
		  KR 2.0.5

  11 Jul 90  RBD  fixed code to work with latest KR

  16 Apr 90  ECP  LISP::%LEXICAL-CLOSURE% only exists in CMU Common Lisp.
		  In Allegro it's EXCL::.LEXICAL-CLOSURE.

  14 Mar 90  RBD  added interbytes to find interactor sizes.

  12 Mar 90  RBD  fixed code to work with latest KR: formulas and schema
                     are now different.
                  added *count-symbols* flag to measure symbol storage

  25 Jan 90  RBD  fixed code to use get-local-values to avoid "inheriting"
