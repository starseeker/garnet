;;; Change log:
;;  2/11/93 Dario Giuse - added code to coerce string name (such as "left")
;; 		       into keyword (such as :LEFT) when reading a new slot
;; 		       name.
;; 12/16/92 Giuse/Mickish - Careful-Read-From-String --> C32-Careful-String-Eval
;;  9/01/92 Andrew Mickish - Commented out declaration of aggrel in HIDESLOT
;;            because its use is commented out; ignore objects(pl.) in Create-New-
;;            Panel-Object; commented out start-event-loop-p in do-go for CMUCL;
;;            moved defparameter of *c32-package* here from c32formula.lisp;
;;            locally bound panels in ShowAllSlots
;;
;;  7/23/92 Dario Giuse - Catching all kinds of errors when a value is being
;; 		       entered.
;;  7/23/92 Dario Giuse - Turned off automatic insertion into the formula window
;; 		       of the reference from the spreadsheet window when
;; 		       the secondary selection is set (with MiddleDown).
;;  7/20/92 Dario Giuse - Made parameters to DO-GO into &key parameters; added
;; 		       the new parameter start-event-loop-p (default T) to
;; 		       determine whether the main event loop should be started.
;; 		       Moved the three commands "Insert Function",
;; 		       "Insert From Spread", and "Insert From Mouse" from the
;; 		       main menu to individual Formula Windows.  This makes
;; 		       it possible to tell which formula they will affect.
;; 		       Changed the "Function:" menu so that clicking on an
;; 		       item selects it, but does nothing.  Then, the command
;; 		       "Insert Function" from a formula window can be used
;; 		       to insert the selected function.
;;  7/17/92 Dario Giuse - Eliminated the "new panel" string object.  Its function
;; 		       is now served by an empty panel, whose title reads
;; 		       "name".  Editing the title creates a
;; 		       new panel for the named object, and moves the empty
;; 		       panel to the right.
;; 		       Editing the title of a panel and specifying a non-
;; 		       existent object name causes C32 to prompt the user.  If
;; 		       the user says OK, the schema is created.  Otherwise,
;; 		       nothing happens.
;;  6/23/92 Dario Giuse - Eliminated :raw-value, which was a dangerous idea
;; 		       that could lead to the same formula being installed
;; 		       on two separate objects.
;;  6/22/92 Dario Giuse - Changed DO-GO so all extra stuff is done by optional
;; 		       parameters.  With the default setting, no test window
;; 		       is created and the panel window starts out empty.
;;  6/15/92 Dario Giuse - Converted formula windows to use multifont objects.
;;  6/12/92 Dario Giuse - Using gg:error-gadget for all error messages.
;; 		       It is now possible to create new objects, by typing
;; 		       their name in the "new-panel" string.  This creates
;; 		       objects that are initially empty.
;;  6/11/92 Dario Giuse - Added a string that allows new panels to be created;
;; 		       the string is to the right of the rightmost panel.
;; 		       Eliminated all scrolling-text interactors; there is
;; 		       now only one per panel.
;;  6/10/92 Dario Giuse - It is now possible to type "<slot> <value>" on the last
;; 		       (empty) slot of a panel, thus specifying both a slot
;; 		       name and a value.
;;  6/08/92 Dario Giuse - Moved empty name for adding new slots to the left.
;; 		       "Add Slot" inherits a value, if any; if not, uses NIL.
;; 		       The secondary selection can now be toggled.
;; 		       Selection bars are kept inside objects when editing
;; 		       the header to switch to another object.
;; 		       Made subwindow wide enough to show right vert. line.
;; 		       Using Update type checking before installing formulas.
;;  6/02/92 Dario Giuse - Added a new "Hide Slot" command.
;;  6/01/92 Dario Giuse - Changed "Delete Slot" to actually eliminate the slot,
;; 		       rather than inheriting a value.
;; 		       Fixed the code so you can type a value which
;; 		       is a list without any extra quotes.  This allows the
;; 		       user to type (:BLUE :GREEN) as a value, for example,
;; 		       rather than (list :BLUE :GREEN) or '(:BLUE :GREEN).
;; 		       Fixed Careful-Read-From-String to detect incorrect
;; 		       formulas (without actually installing them) and give
;; 		       an error message.
;; 		       Setting the package to "C32" when reading from strings
;; 		       for formulas.  At least, this eliminates the need to
;; 		       type things like "kr:gvl".  Is there a better solution,
;; 		       such as setting some package in C32 for later use?
;;  5/29/92 Dario Giuse - Added new mechanism to create new slots in objects:
;; 		       editing the text in the last (empty) slot of a browser
;; 		       shows the slot (if present), or creates it with a
;; 		       NIL value if not present.
;; 		       Improved error messages by using the error structure
;; 		       returned by ignore-errors (in Allegro).
;;  5/27/92 Dario Giuse - Fixed Careful-Get-Obj to work with lowercase names.
;; 		       Fixed problem with careful-get-value.
;; 		       Values are always printed without #k<...>
;;  5/18/92 Dario Giuse - Converted to Garnet 2.0
;;  3/29/91 Brad Myers  - Put on a user interface
;;  9/11/90 Brad Myers  - Started

  07/22/93 Dario Giuse - added Lisp Mode to formula window
  07/15/93 Andrew Mickish - #+lcl3.0 ---> #+lucid
  07/09/93 Andrew Mickish - Condition type is undefined for Lucid
  03/11/93 Dario Giuse - fixed C32-Careful-String-Eval to work properly
	   when *current-formula-obj* is nil.  This happens, for example,
	   when editing a new slot name in a panel.
  03/02/93 Andrew Mickish - Removed superfluous quote from :items list in
             Form-Win-Header.
