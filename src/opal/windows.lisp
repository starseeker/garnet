;;; Changes:
;;;
;;; 20-Aug-98 Gilham  Setting :very-first-exposure slot to t seems to
;;;                   cause problems with windows not properly displaying
;;;                   when first created. Eliminate it for CMUCL at least.
;;; 10-Jun-94 Mickish Don't set :very-first-exposure slot for Mac
;;; 05-May-94 Mickish Raise-window and lower-window now signal an error if
;;;                   their arugment is not a real window
;;; 14-Apr-94 Mickish Special Mac stuff in Configure-Notify
;;; 15-Jan-94 Mickish Called gem:color-to-index in Create-X-Drawable
;;;  9-Jan-94 Mickish New function Install-Bitmap-Images now called from
;;;                   Initialize-Display
;;; 15-Dec-93 Mickish Commented out body of Set-Window-Cursor for Mac
;;; 27-Oct-93 Mickish Only set :title of window if appropriate
;;; 06-Sep-93 Clive Tong  Use special Map-Window-And-Wait for LispWorks
;;; 03-Aug-93 Mickish Destroyed drawables that have title bars when reparenting
;;; 28-Jul-93 Mickish Removed title bars when reparenting top-level windows
;;; 20-May-93 Mickish Fixed left-border-width for DECwindows
;;; 17-May-93  koz    On an exposure with count>0, just merge the exposed
;;;                   bbox into the window's win-update-info-exposed-bbox
;;;                   (so we get only one update call per exposure).
;;; 22-Apr-93 Mickish Added With-Cursor and With-HourGlass-Cursor
;;; 19-Apr-93 Mickish Added font-from-file and :CURSOR to Set-Window-Cursor
;;; 24-Mar-93  koz    Better window reparenting: rewrote fix-window-properties
;;;                   for slot :parent (also, create-x-drawable now sets
;;;                   the :old-parent slot of the window)
;;; 18-Jan-93 Mickish Added Change-Cursors and Restore-Cursors
;;; 16-Jan-93 Mickish In Fix-Window-Properties, compensate for border widths
;;;                   when setting :left and :top of windows; in delete-notify,
;;;                   destroy orphaned drawables when appropriate
;;;  4-Jan-93 Mickish Added checks for NIL drawables to event functions (like
;;;                   opal::Exposure) since opal:clean-up destroys drawables.
;;; 21-Dec-92 Mickish Added display-force-output calls to raise-window and
;;;                   lower-window; rewrote Set-Window-Cursor to reuse old
;;;                   xlib:cursor objects.
;;; 10-Dec-92 Mickish *drawable-to-window-mapping* ---> *garnet-windows*
;;; 28-Oct-92 hopkins In Initialize-Window-Border-Widths, changed border-width
;;;                   computations for TVTWM
;;; 22-Oct-92  koz    Added #'zoom-window and #'fullzoom-window
;;;  6-Oct-92  koz    Changed #'update-slot-invalidated to a g-value
;;;                   of opal:WINDOW :invalidate-demon
;;; 11-Sep-92 Duchier Changed "(4 6)" clauses in Configure-Notify and
;;;                   Initialize-Window-Border-Widths for tvtwm
;;; 24-Jun-92 Pervin  Add #-clx-cl-error test before xlib:drawable-root.
;;; 29-May-92 Pervin  Lispworks switch
;;; 27-May-92 Pervin  Added :save-under slot to windows.
;;; 18-May-92 Pervin  In configure-notify, check that windows are not destroyed.
;;; 13-May-92 Pervin  Only do map-window-and-wait if xlib:window-map-state
;;;		      of window is :unmapped.  Do map-window-and-wait in
;;;		      Allegro version 4 after all.
;;;  4-May-92 Almond  Allegro-v4.1 switches
;;; 29-Apr-92 Pervin  Reduced :timeout in map-window-and-wait to 5 sec.
;;;		      Only do wait in map-window-and-wait in Lucid and Allegro <4.0.
;;; 21-Apr-92 Pervin  Using new function main-event-loop-process-running-p
;;; 20-Apr-92 Pervin  Fixed minor bug in raise-window.
;;; 16-Apr-92 Pervin  At end of Configure-notify, do not update windows that have
;;;		      never been updated before. (see change of 6-Sep-90).
;;;		      Also, need special case for if xlib:query-tree doesn't work.
;;; 14-Apr-92 Pervin  Uncommented out process code.  Got multiprocess to work on HP.
;;;  8-Apr-92 Davis   In fix-window-properties, when changed slot is :aggregate,
;;;		      check that old-agg is not destroyed.
;;;  8-Apr-92 Pervin  On a black-and-white screen, draw background-color white
;;;		      except when background-color is actually opal:black.
;;; 31-Mar-92 Pervin  New :draw-on-children slot of window.
;;; 31-Mar-92 Szekely New :icon-bitmap slot of window holds pixmap of icon.
;;; 30-Mar-92 Pervin  Temporarily commenting out process code.
;;; 25-Mar-92 Pervin  Make default-event-handler be only defined in i-windows.lisp.
;;;		      Use switch #+clx-cl-error to check for query-tree bug.
;;; 20-Mar-92 Pervin  Use launch-main-event-loop-process.
;;; 19-Mar-92 Mickish Bound a-window-update-info in :initialize method for
;;;                   windows to eliminate CMUCL compiler warnings
;;; 18-Mar-92 Pervin  Map-window-and-wait no longer needed now that we
;;;		      have main event loop process.
;;; 11-Mar-92 Pervin  New width and height fields of win-update-info.
;;;  5-Mar-92 Pervin  If a window is iconified before it is first updated,
;;;		      its initial state should be :iconic.
;;;		      Also, should use xlib:withdraw-window, not xlib:unmap-window
;;; 27-Feb-92 Pervin  Added deiconify-window.
;;; 19-Feb-92 Pervin  Implemented double-clip-mask as list of length 8.
;;; 11-Feb-92 Pervin  Vastly simplified expand-buffer to just create new buffer
;;; 03-Jan-92 Mickish Changed to call with-demon-disabled.
;;; 31-Jan-92 Pervin  Eliminated *display-name-to-display-mapping*.
;;;		      Rewrote initialize-display to take no arguments,
;;;		      and always set display-info-display to be default.
;;;		      This was needed for conversion to CMUCL.
;;; 23-Jan-92 Pervin  Call *exit-main-event-loop-function* instead of throwing
;;;                   exception.
;;; 21-Jan-91 Pervin  Remove subwindow from parent when it is destroyed.
;;;  9-Jan-91 Pervin  Map-window-and-wait routine.
;;; 16-Dec-91 Pervin  Removed the section of Exposure that merged several
;;;		      exposure events.
;;;  9-Dec-91 Pervin  opal-gc has new stored-clip-mask field
;;;  5-Dec-91 Pervin  In Exposure, do not re-update window that has been
;;;                   exposed for the very first time.
;;; 26-Nov-91 Pervin  changed clear-buffer to correctly handle double-buffered
;;;		      windows with background color.
;;; 25-Nov-91 koz     changed fix-properties method to fix-window-properties
;;;                   function and altered # of args to it (it's only called
;;;                   from within update-windows, and this is more efficient)
;;; 18-Nov-91 Pervin  Added :background-color to windows.
;;;  5-Nov-91 Irwin   You may now destroy a window using f.delete or f.kill.
;;;		      Also, a window can have :min-width, :min-height,
;;;		      :max-width, and :max-height.
;;; 24-Oct-91 Pervin  Exit main-event-loop automatically if no windows visible
;;;                   Also :visible is set to :iconified if you iconify by hand
;;;  9-Oct-91 Szekely Fixed OpenWindows bug in Configure-notify.
;;; 25-Jun-91 Meltsner  Fixed :lineage of DECWindows.
;;;  7-Jun-91 Pervin  Added kr:with-demons-disabled inside map-notify and
;;;		      unmap-notify.
;;; 30-May-91 Pervin  Fixed bug so window will not de-iconify if you
;;;		      call inter:main-event-loop after calling iconify-window.
;;;  4-Apr-91 Pervin  New slot :omit-title-bar-p for windows.
;;; 18-Mar-91 Pervin  Xlib:query-tree seems to have been fixed in
;;;		      Allegro Version 4.0.
;;; 21-Feb-91 Pervin  New exported routine iconify-window.
;;; 31-Jan-91 Pervin  In fix-properties, when a window is made visible,
;;;                   call xlib:map-window last.
;;; 12-Nov-90 Pervin  Made first argument to convert-coordinates optional.
;;;  9-Nov-90 Pervin  Made second argument to convert-coordinates optional.
;;; 31-Oct-90 Pervin  Finally added convert-coordinates, which I'd
;;;                   forgotten before.
;;; 29-Oct-90 Pervin  Fixed bug found by Brad VanderZanden involving
;;;                   expanding a double-buffered window (caused by
;;;                   misprint in Configure-Notify).
;;; 25-Oct-90 Pervin  New exported commands opal:raise-window and
;;;                     opal:lower-window which move window to front or
;;;                     back of screen.
;;; 22-Oct-90 Pervin  Changed #+pmax to #+allegro since I found that
;;;		      xlib:query-tree no longer works on the Sun Allegro
;;;		      at CMU either.  This is a TEMPORARY change.  In time
;;;		      I hope whoever is responsible can get xlib:query-tree
;;;                   working.
;;; 10-Sep-90 Meltsner Fixed bug in initialize-window-border-widths of
;;;		      DECWindow users.     w5 --> p5
;;;  6-Sep-90 Pervin  Added an update-all at the end of Configure-Notify.
;;; 24-Aug-90 Pervin  You can now reset the :title and :icon-title
;;;		      of a window.
;;; 15-Aug-90 Pervin  Removed :display branch of case statement
;;;		      in fix-properties.
;;; 13-Aug-90 Pervin  Added code to handle DECWindows window manager.
;;; 10-Aug-90 Pervin  It turns out that I did need that event-case at
;;;		      the end of create-x-drawable after all (see 2-Aug-90).
;;;  9-Aug-90 Pervin  Added temporary #+pmax stuff because currently
;;;		      xlib:query-tree does not work on the Pmax.
;;;  3-Aug-90 Pervin  In Configure-Notify, check is window has parent.
;;;  2-Aug-90 Pervin  Reparent-notify must reset :lineage slot.
;;;		      Also, didn't need event-case at end of create-x-drawable.
;;;  1-Aug-90 Pervin  Made it so that the :width and :height slots of
;;;		      windows are based on the inside, rather than the
;;;		      outside of the window.
;;; 30-Jul-90 Pervin  Big changes in initialize-window-border-widths
;;;		      and Configure-Notify to handle MWM window manager.
;;;		      Got rid of :just-did-configure slot, but added
;;;		      new :lineage slot.
;;; 18-Jul-90 Pervin  Moved the call to initialize-window-border-widths
;;;		      yet again -- this time, to inside Configure-Notify.
;;;		      Also, expand-buffer uses :width, :height slots of
;;;		      window being expanded.
;;; 13-Jul-90 Pervin  New :destroy-me method for windows.
;;;		      I had to remove the optional erase argument.
;;;  5-Jul-90 Pervin  In Exposure, don't need special case for
;;;		      double-buffered window.
;;;  2-Jul-90 Pervin  If an expose event occurs, just refresh the parts
;;;                   of the window that were exposed.
;;; 26-Jun-90 Pervin  Extended :just-did-configure test to :width and
;;;                   :height slots, as well as :top and :left.
;;; 18-Jun-90 Pervin  Variable *clear* for erasing buffers.
;;;  5-Jun-90 Pervin  Implemented double-buffering.
;;;  4-Jun-90 Myers   Added :just-did-configure slot to windows
;;;		      in order to get rid of *twm-bug*
;;; 25-May-90 Pervin  Call initialize-window-border-widths only at the
;;;		      very end of create-x-drawable.
;;;  8-May-90 Sannella/Pervin
;;;                   The way of specifying a user-positioned window
;;;                   has changed.  Now we use the :user-specified-position-p
;;;                   argument to xlib:set-standard-properties.
;;; 19-Mar-90 Pervin  Changed :tile to :stipple.  Added reference to *twm-bug*
;;; 12-Mar-90 Pervin  Setting :title and :icon-title of windows
;;;		      in :initialize method.
;;; 28-Feb-90 Pervin  Fixed bug in set-window-cursor.
;;;		      Now it works in Lucid and Allegro too!
;;; 14-Feb-90 Pervin  Commented out body of set-window-cursor.
;;; 13-Feb-90 Pervin  Implemented color.
;;;  5-Dec-89 Pervin  Moved new-garnet-window-name to new-defs.lisp
;;;
