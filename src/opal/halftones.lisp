;;; Change Log:
;;;     date     who    what
;;;     ----     ---    ----
;;;    8-Sep-94  Amickish Added initialize-halftones to be called by X and Mac
;;;   25-Jan-94  Amickish Do not associate opal:white-fill with the halftone
;;;                       table, because it is now a solid fill.
;;;    9-Jan-94  Amickish Added Install-Bitmap-Images
;;;   17-Dec-93  Amickish Called gem:Device-Image in Build-Halftone-Table
;;;    6-Oct-92  koz      changed #'update-slot-invalidated to a g-value
;;;                       of opal:GRAPHICAL-OBJECT :invalidate-demon
;;;   10-Mar-92  Pervin   Rewrote find-halftone.
;;;    3-Jan-92  Mickish  Changed to call with-demons-disabled.
;;;    4-Mar-91  D'Souza  Removed nickname "MO" of package Opal.
;;;   21-Feb-91  Pervin   Changed bitmap images in the halftone-table so that
;;;                       each halftone strictly contains the one before it.
;;;    8-May-90  Sannella The R4 CLX version of xlib:bitmap-image needs
;;;                       arguments like #*1011 instead of '#(1 1 0 1)
;;;   19-Mar-90  Pervin   Changed tile to stipple
;;;   13-Feb-90  Pervin   Implemented color.
;;;   07-Jul-89  Kosbie   Placed these within "WITH-DEMONS-DISABLED"
;;;   15-Jun-89  Kosbie   Added s-values to *-FILL-BITMAPs :image slots after the
;;;			  function "halftone-image" was defined.
