;;; Changes:
;;   10/02/03 RGA --- Moved to KR package
;;   08/19/93 RGA Extensions to KR to support Facets.
;;  =======================================================


;;; This package introduces a documentation convention for KR objects
;;  and provides some simple functions to read that documentation.
;;
;; The first half of the convention is easy.  Each schema can have a
;; slot called :documentation which contains information for the
;; programmer about the schema.

;; The second half of the convention provides information about
;; slots.  This is done through the :slot-doc slot of the schema.
;; This is a paired list of the form slot-name, doc-string.  

;; The function kr:get-slot-doc (<schema> <slot>) accesses the
;; doc-string for a schema. It will search first the local slot and
;; then back through the inheritence chain to find the documentation
;; for a slot.  The function kr:set-slot-doc  (<schema> <slot>
;; <value>) will set the documentation associated with the slot.

;; In order to prevent documentation strings from adding volume to
;; images where they are not wanted, I've added a feature switch
;; kr-doc.  This should be used to protect documentation when it is
;; not wanted (i.e., when this file has not been loaded first.)
;; Example:
;;  (kr:create-instance 'verbose-rectangle opal:rectangle
;;    #+kr-doc (:documentation "Opal:rectangle with documentation strings.")
;;    #+kr-doc (:slot-doc :left "Horizontal Co-ordinate for Rectangle."
;;		          :top "Vertical Co-ordinate for Rectangle."
;;		          :height "Vertical Extent of Rectangle."
;;		          :width "Horizontal Extent of Rectangle."
;;		          :line-style "The color, width and dashing of the border."
;;		          :filling-style "The color and shading of the interior." 
;;		          :draw-function "How does drawing interact with
;;                                        objects underneath."
;;		          :visible "Is the object to be drawn?"))
