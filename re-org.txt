Re-organization of Garnet sources:

1) Maybe we should go back to the old structure with 
src, lib and bin directories.  Reasons:

a) I find it more convenient given that I need to maintain both MCL
and ACL binaries, both of which are conveniently named "fasl".  It
also makes it easier to do testing on older version of Lisp.

b) Fred Gilham has not been participating in the sourceforge project
in large part because of the difficulty of dealing with the changed
layout.  

I can live with the former, but the latter seems and excellent reason
to go back to the original layout.

2) Unbundling contrib code.

I'm proposing that we move the following code into 
garnet-gadgets from contrib:

choice-gadget.lisp
ritter-labeled-box.lisp
prompter/scrolling-unlabeled-box-loader.lisp
prompter/scrolling-unlabeled-box.lisp

I'm also proposing moving 
kr-doc.lisp 
from contrib to kr, but it would not be loaded by default.  If kr-doc
is loaded before the rest of garnet, then the KR doc string will be
loaded as well.  This allows people to reduce the size of the garnet
footprint, but putting 
#+kr-doc
	(:documentation "....")
#+kr-doc
	(:slot-doc :left "..." ...)

will keep unwanted stuff out.


Finally, I'll move/merge all of the prompter code into the
protected-eval package.


3)  #+garnet-test

I've added an extra compile switch #+garnet-test and used it to
comment out a lot of test code in the garnet-gadgets package.  This
made a substantial reduction in the size of the garnet footprint.




I tagged the pre-org structure with the tag RGApreReorg.
I'll tag the post-reorg structure with the tage RGApostReorg.
